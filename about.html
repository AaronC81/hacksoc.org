    <h2>hacker [n.]</h2>
    <p class="aside">[originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe]</p>
  </header>

  <p>A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems
  and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who
  prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the Internet
  Users' Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights
  in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a
  system, computers and computer networks in particular.</p>

<p><strong>HackSoc</strong> is the University of York's Computer
Science&mdash;or, more generally, computer enthusiast&mdash;society.
We run mostly programming events: short series of lectures, seminars,
competitions, projects, and the like. However, we're not just about
the academic side of things, we also run socials! Boardgames and Cake
and HackPub are our staple social activities, but we're also
considering more possibilities, such as movie nights.</p>

<p>If any of this sounds interesting to you, great! We don't charge a
membership fee, so feel free to just turn up to any events that catch
your eye. If you'd like regular updates on what is happening in
HackSoc, don't forget to sign up to our mailing list or follow us on
Facebook and Twitter!</p>

<h2>Get in touch</h2>
<p>We're available through email, IRC, Facebook, and Twitter! We also
have a mailing list which we use for announcements of events.</p>
