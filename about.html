    <h2>hacker [n.]</h2>
    <p class="aside">[originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe]</p>
  </header>

  <p>A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems
  and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who
  prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the Internet
  Users' Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights
  in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a
  system, computers and computer networks in particular.</p>

<p><strong>HackSoc</strong> is the University of York's Computer
Science&mdash;or, more generally, computer enthusiast&mdash;society.
We run programming events, lectures, seminars, competitions, projects,
and the like. However, we're not just about the academic side of
things, we also run socials! Boardgames and Cake and HackPub are the
staples, but we also run movie nights, and a weekly social in the
Glasshouse.</p>

<p>If any of this sounds interesting to you, great! We don't enforce
the membership fee (Â£4/year) for most things, so feel free to just turn up to
any events that catch your eye&mdash;however, if you <em>do</em> pay,
you can make use of our shell server, <a href="http://runciman.hacksoc.org">runciman</a>.
If you'd like regular updates on what is happening in HackSoc, don't
forget to sign up to our mailing list or follow us on Facebook and
Twitter!</p>

<h2>Get in touch</h2>
<p>We're available through email, IRC, Facebook, and Twitter! We also
have a mailing list which we use for announcements of events.</p>
