    <h2>hacker [n.]</h2>
    <p class="aside">[originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe]</p>
  </header>

  <p>A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems
  and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who
  prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the Internet
  Users' Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights
  in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a
  system, computers and computer networks in particular.</p>
