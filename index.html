  <h2>Weekly Talks</h2>
  <p>Talks on mostly-technical topics of mostly-general interest.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox alternate">
  <h2>Boardgames and Cake</h2>
  <p>In one of the oldest and noblest traditions of HackSoc, we shall descend upon a room, play many boardgames, and eat much cake. Both boardgames and cake are brought along by members, so if you do enjoy the events, please consider bringing something along some time.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox">
  <h2>CoffeeScript</h2>
  <p>An unprecedented case of joviality and camaraderie has struck HackSoc this year, and we are responding by trying out a brand new weekly social over in the Glasshouse on Hes East. We don't really know what we're doing yet, so we're just going to play it by ear.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox alternate">
  <h2>HackPub</h2>
  <p>Another tradition with a long and glorious history, the humble HackPub, in which we visit one of York's many fine pubs and converse late into the night about high culture, politics, and how old jet engines work over a pint (of something nonalcoholic, if you so desire).</p>
