<div class="infobox">
  <h2>Programming Competition</h2>
  <p>People will be divided up into teams of roughly equal ability, and will race to complete a given set of problems, with the team solving the most problems winning the grand prize of a box of chocolates! Or the team which uses the most unsuitable programming language. Or the team which makes the most amusing thing. We're not too fussy.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox alternate">
  <h2>End of Term Pub Quiz</h2>
  <p>A pub quiz, the true way to separate the men from the boys! Your first-year knowledge will be put to the test in this surprisingly academic pub quiz, but with rounds on general knowledge, computer science history, and general nerdery, there should be something for everyone.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox">
  <h2>Boardgames and Cake</h2>
  <p>In one of the oldest and noblest traditions of HackSoc, we shall descend upon a room, play many boardgames, and eat much cake. Both boardgames and cake are brought along by members, so if you do enjoy the events, please consider bringing something along some time.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox alternate">
  <h2>CoffeeScript</h2>
  <p>An unprecedented case of joviality and camaraderie has struck HackSoc this year, and we are responding by trying out a brand new weekly social over in the Glasshouse on Hes East. We don't really know what we're doing yet, so we're just going to play it by ear.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox">
  <h2>HackPub</h2>
  <p>Another tradition with a long and glorious history, the humble HackPub, in which we visit one of York's many fine pubs and converse late into the night about high culture, politics, and how old jet engines work over a pint (of something nonalcoholic, if you so desire).</p>
