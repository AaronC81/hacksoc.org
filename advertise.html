<p>HackSoc is a society filled with technologically-minded people, and so it's
only natural that we get requests to forward advertisements to the society members.
However, we recognise that not everyone is interested in this, and so we instead
provide a separate mailing list, <strong>hacksoc-jobs</strong>, for this purpose.
Anyone can subscribe to the mailing list, but in order to send a message to it,
you must contact the committee.</p>

<h2>Members</h2>

<p>Want to receive job or project offers? Then sign up to the 
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/yusu.org/forum/#!forum/hacksoc-jobs-list">hacksoc-jobs</a> 
mailing list! You can email <a href="hacksoc-jobs-list+subscribe@yusu.org">hacksoc-jobs-list+subscribe@yusu.org</a>, 
or sign up online.</p>

<h2>Advertisers</h2>

<p>Are you a business trying to recruit graduating students? Or perhaps
just a student with a new idea. If you think you have a task which members of
HackSoc would be suited for, contact <a href="mailto:hack@yusu.org">hack@yusu.org</a> with your
advertisement, and we shall forward it to the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/yusu.org/forum/#!forum/hacksoc-jobs-list">hacksoc-jobs</a>
mailing list.</p>
