<h2>Weekly CS Seminars</h2>
<h3>Location and Times</h3>
<p><strong>CSE/102</strong> at <strong>13:15</strong> every Wednesday.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>We intend to pick textbooks and other such resources, and work through them over a period of time. Each seminar shall begin with a short presentation of the current topic, followed by discussion of that topic. Once it has been exhausted, we shall move on to general computer science and programming discussion.</p>
<p>It is not essential to have done the reading to attend the seminars, nor do we want it to be. If you want to do the reading beforehand and think about things before we all discuss it, that's great!</p>

<h3>Content</h3>
<h4>Science Fiction Reading Group</h4>
<p>As it is exam term, we didn't want to do anything too academic, or which required consistent attendance. Thus, we have a reading group, where we shall discuss computer science issues (if we want) raised in the stories.</p>
<p><strong>There shall be no seminars in weeks 5, 6, and 7</strong></p>
<p>We shall cover the following stories and topics in order:</p>
