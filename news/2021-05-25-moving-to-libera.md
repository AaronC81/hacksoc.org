title: \#hacksoc Is Moving To libera.chat
---

Due to recent events at Freenode, as summarised [here][summary], 
HackSoc will be moving all its irc channels from Freenode to 
[Libera Chat][libera].

The #hacksoc channel on Libera Chat will be bridged to slack in much 
the same way as the current Freenode channel is. 

#cs-york also has a channel on Libera Chat, with the same people as 
usually hang out there. 

Libera Chat does not yet have a webchat. If you haven't got an irc 
client, then we recommend using [The Lounge][thelounge]. This does 
not require any special program. If you want an account, please 
contact us at hack@yusu.org, or poke the infrastructure officer.
