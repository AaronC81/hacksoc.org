\section{Version Control}

A version control system (VCS) is a tool (or collection of tools)
which make working on multiple versions of something, be it a program,
website, document, whatever, and keeping track of all of the changes
much easier. If it helps, you can think of a VCS as a glorified undo
tool.

If you're used to developing software by first making a backup of the
file you want to work on, and then editing the original file (or even
just editing the original file); or by editing the live system rather
than an offline copy; you need version control.

The work-flow for version control is a bit different:

\begin{description}
  \item[Edit] the appropriate files, there is no need to take a backup
    first.
  \item[Test] your changes. Of course, you did this before, right?
  \item[Commit] your changes, that is, tell the VCS which files you
    have changed and (usually) enter a short message explaining what
    you did.
  \item[Deploy] your commits, that is, send your commits to a server,
    or some other user. If you're the sole user of the VCS for your
    project, this may not be necessary (but can still be good---more
    on that later).
\end{description}

You may think that having to enter a message for each commit is a
hassle. Well, consider that by entering a good message, you'll be able
to see what the commit did. This may be incredibly useful down the
line when you're trying to find out where you introduced a bug, or
removed something that was needed. By using a VCS, you're not just
giving yourself an easy way to undo things, you're building a
detailed history of the development of your project, which is an
invaluable tool in itself.

Eventually, you will make a commit that you realise was a bad
idea. It's inevitable. It's ok. You can tell people you were drunk
when you did it. Fortunately, we come to another strength of VCSs
here, undoing things. Every VCS (that I know of) has some way to tell
the system to undo a specific commit. How this is implemented
varies---the commit may simply vanish, or the system may insert a new
commit reverting all of its changes. You may also need to do some
manual intervention, if you're undoing something which you have since
built upon.

Finally, let's cover branches and merging in this introduction. These
are key concepts in the VCS workflow, and entire development paradigms
have sprung up around how to use branches correctly (we'll be looking
at two). A branch is a copy of your code. Each branch can be distinct,
and branches can be merged (perhaps with some manual intervention
required) at any time as well. It's possibly easiest to explain with
a couple of examples of typical branches you may have:

\begin{description}
  \item[master] this is typically your stable, production-ready
    code.
  \item[devel] depending on your workflow, you may also have a
    development branch. This will be ahead of master, and will be
    merged into master when you have implemented everything you want
    for the next release
  \item[hotfixes] again, depending on your workflow, you may have a
    branch for emergency fixes to releases. This will also be ahead of
    master, but only by a handful of commits at a time, after which
    point it will be merged and a new release made.
\end{description}

Of course, where branches really come into their own is when you have
a good workflow based around them. It's also typical to have ``feature
branches'', one branch for each new feature you are implementing,
which is them merged into the development branch when complete.
